          JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language
          used to make webpages interactive (e.g., having complex animations,
          clickable buttons, popup menus, etc.). There are also more advanced
          server side versions of JavaScript such as Node.js, which allow you to
          add more functionality to a website than downloading files (such as
          realtime collaboration between multiple computers). Inside a host
          environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected
          to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over
          them. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by
          supplementing it with additional objects; for example:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying
            objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM).
            For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place
            elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse
            clicks, form input, and page navigation.
          </li>
          <li>
            Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying
            objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example,
            server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a
            database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to
            another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a
            server.
          </li>
        </ul>

          JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally
          different in some others. The JavaScript language resembles Java but
          does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking.
          JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and
          basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was renamed
          from LiveScript to JavaScript.
        </p>

      <section class="main-section"  id="Declaration">
        <header>Declaration</header>
        <p>You can declare a variable in two ways:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            With the keyword var. For example, var x = 42. This syntax can be
            used to declare both local and global variables, depending on the
            <i>execution context</i>.
          </li>
          <li>
            With the keyword const or let. For example, let y = 13. This syntax
            can be used to declare a block-scope local variable. (See Variable
            scope below.)
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          You can declare variables to unpack values using the destructuring
          assignment syntax. For example, <code>const { bar } = foo</code>. This
          will create a variable named <code>bar</code> and assign to it the
          value corresponding to the key of the same name from our object
          <code>foo</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Variables should always be declared before they are used. JavaScript
          used to allow assigning to undeclared variables, which creates an
          undeclared global variable. This is an error in strict mode and should
          be avoided altogether.

      <section class="main-section"  id="Data_Structures_and_Types">
        <header>Data Structures and Types</header>
        <p>The latest ECMAScript standard defines eight data types:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Seven data types that are primitives:
            <ol>
              <li>Boolean. <code>true</code> and <code>false</code>.</li>
              <li>null. A special keyword denoting a null value.</li>
              <li>
                undefined. A top-level property whose value is not defined.
              </li>
              <li>
                Number. An integer or floating point number. For example: 42 or
                3.14159.
              </li>
              <li>
                BigInt. An integer with arbitrary precision. For example:
                9007199254740992n.
              </li>
              <li>
                String. A sequence of characters that represent a text value.
                For example: <code>"Howdy"</code>.
              </li>
              <li>
                Symbol. A data type whose instances are unique and immutable.
              </li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>and Objects</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Although these data types are relatively few, they enable you to
          perform useful operations with your applications. Functions are the
          other fundamental elements of the language. While functions are
          technically a kind of object, you can think of objects as named
          containers for values, and functions as procedures that your script
          can perform.

      <section class="main-section"  id="Conditional_Statements">
        <header>Conditional Statements</header>
        <p>
          The most basic statement is a block statement, which is used to group
          statements. The block is delimited by a pair of curly braces:
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code class="block-code">
          {
            statement1;
            statement2;
            // …
            statementN;
          }
          </code>
        </pre>

        <p>
          Example: Block statements are commonly used with control flow
          statements (if, for, while).
        </p>

        <pre>
          <code class="block-code">
            while (x < 10) {
            x++;
            }
          </code>
        </pre>
        <p>Here, <code>{ x++; }</code> is the block statement.</p>
      </section>

      <hr />

      <section class="main-section"  id="if_else_Statements">
        <header>if else Statements</header>
        <p>
          Use the if statement to execute a statement if a logical condition is
          true. Use the optional else clause to execute a statement if the
          condition is false. An if statement looks like this:
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code class="block-code">
            if (condition) {
              statement1;
            } else {
              statement2;
            }            
          </code>
        </pre>

        <p>
          Here, the condition can be any expression that evaluates to true or
          false. If condition evaluates to true, statement_1 is executed.
          Otherwise, statement_2 is executed. statement_1 and statement_2 can be
          any statement, including further nested if statements. You can also
          compound the statements using else if to have multiple conditions
          tested in sequence, as follows:
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code class="block-code">
            if (condition1) {
              statement1;
            } else if (condition2) {
              statement2;
            } else if (conditionN) {
              statementN;
            } else {
              statementLast;
            }            
          </code>
        </pre>
      </section>

      <hr />

      <section class="main-section"  id="switch_Statements">
        <header>switch Statements</header>

        <p>
          A switch statement allows a program to evaluate an expression and
          attempt to match the expression's value to a case label. If a match is
          found, the program executes the associated statement. A switch
          statement looks like this:
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code class="block-code">
            switch (expression) {
              case label1:
                statements1;
                break;
              case label2:
                statements2;
                break;
              // …
              default:
                statementsDefault;
            }            
          </code>
        </pre>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The program first looks for a case clause with a label matching the
            value of expression and then transfers control to that clause,
            executing the associated statements.
          </li>
          <li>
            If no matching label is found, the program looks for the optional
            default clause.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <hr />

      <section class="main-section"  id="for_Loop">
        <header>for Loop</header>
        <p>
          A 'for' loop repeats until a specified condition evaluates to false.
          The JavaScript 'for' loop is similar to the Java and C 'for' loop. A
          for statement looks as follows:
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code class="block-code">
            for (initialization; condition; afterthought) 
            // statement
          </code>
        </pre>
        <p>When a for loop executes, the following occurs:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            The initializing expression initialization, if any, is executed.
            This expression usually initializes one or more loop counters, but
            the syntax allows an expression of any degree of complexity. This
            expression can also declare variables.
          </li>
          <li>
            The condition expression is evaluated. If the value of condition is
            true, the loop statements execute. Otherwise, the for loop
            terminates. (If the condition expression is omitted entirely, the
            condition is assumed to be true.)
          </li>
          <li>
            The statement executes. To execute multiple statements, use a block
            statement ({ }) to group those statements.
          </li>
          <li>If present, the update expression afterthought is executed.</li>
          <li>Control returns to Step 2.</li>
        </ol>
      </section>

      <hr />
      <section class="main-section"  id="while_Loop">
        <header>while Loop</header>
        <p>
          A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified
          condition evaluates to true. A while statement looks as follows:
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code class="block-code">
            while (condition)
            //statement
          </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
          If the condition becomes false, statement within the loop stops
          executing and control passes to the statement following the loop. The
          condition test occurs before statement in the loop is executed. If the
          condition returns true, statement is executed and the condition is
          tested again. If the condition returns false, execution stops, and
          control is passed to the statement following while. To execute
          multiple statements, use a block statement ({ }) to group those
          statements.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section"  id="Functions">
        <header>Functions</header>
        <p>
          Functions are one of the fundamental building blocks in JavaScript. A
          function in JavaScript is similar to a procedure—a set of statements
          that performs a task or calculates a value, but for a procedure to
          qualify as a function, it should take some input and return an output
          where there is some obvious relationship between the input and the
          output. To use a function, you must define it somewhere in the scope
          from which you wish to call it.
        </p>
        <p>
          A function definition (also called a function declaration, or function
          statement) consists of the function keyword, followed by:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>The name of the function.</li>
          <li>
            A list of parameters to the function, enclosed in parentheses and
            separated by commas.
          </li>
          <li>
            The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in
            curly braces, { /* … */ }.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <pre>
          <code class="block-code">
            function square(number) {
              return number * number;
            }
          </code>
        </pre>

        <p>
          The function square takes one parameter, called number. The function
          consists of one statement that says to return the parameter of the
          function (that is, number) multiplied by itself. The return statement
          specifies the value returned by the function, which is number *
          number.

      <section class="main-section"  id="Expressions_and_Operators">
        <header>Expressions and Operators</header>
        <p>
          At a high level, an expression is a valid unit of code that resolves
          to a value. There are two types of expressions: those that have side
          effects (such as assigning values) and those that purely evaluate. The
          expression 'x = 7' is an example of the first type. This expression
          uses the '=' operator to assign the value seven to the variable x. The
          expression itself evaluates to 7. The expression '3 + 4' is an example
          of the second type. This expression uses the + operator to add 3 and 4
          together and produces a value, 7. However, if it's not eventually part
          of a bigger construct (for example, a variable declaration like const
          z = 3 + 4), its result will be immediately discarded — this is usually
          a programmer mistake because the evaluation doesn't produce any
          effects. As the examples above also illustrate, all complex
          expressions are joined by operators, such as = and +. In this section,
          we will introduce the following operators:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Assignment operators</li>
          <li>Comparison operators</li>
          <li>Arithmetic operators</li>
